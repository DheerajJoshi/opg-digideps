<h2 class="heading-medium">How we store data</h2>

<div class="text">
  <p>All data collected by this service is stored within the European Economic Area (EEA). However, due to the global nature of the internet, the data sent to and from the database may transit through countries outside of the EEA. Data is not stored in a non-EEA country.</p>

  <p>If you contact us to let us know you're experiencing a technical problem with your account, we may give authorised members of OPG staff temporary access to your data so they can investigate the problem. Once the investigation is complete, these members of staff will no longer be able to access your data.</p>
