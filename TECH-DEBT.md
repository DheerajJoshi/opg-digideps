# Tech Debt

This file should be used to record known debt.

If any debt may lead to larger risks, it should be transferred to the risk board. If we have identified an agreed solution to pay down the debt, it should be moved to a ticket in JIRA.

## CI
- Stabilize runs too soon and may exit before deployment has started
- Notify channel when environment ready

## Infra
- scheduled scaling for cost saving
- remove dependency on semvertag
- makefile deprecated
- periodically rotate CI access key & ses users
- move public routes to main route table
- Per environment certificates or universal wildcard
- Move to secrets per account
- Nginx timeout is universally high to allow for some use cases (e.g. compiling zips)

## Application
- Separate config files/entrypoints are inflexible and obfuscating, should use feature flags instead
- YAML files generated by confd reduce image portability
- `behat-debugger.php` requires specific nginx configuration and isn't very useful
- `web/assets` being generated in frontend image means it can't be mounted for live-editing

## Design
- Status label texts are variously defined in `common.en.yml`, `ndr-overview.en.yml` and `report-overview.en.yml`
- Many templates are duplicated (e.g. start, yes/no questions, add another)
