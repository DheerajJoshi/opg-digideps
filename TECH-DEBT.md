# TODO

This file should be used to record known debt.

If any debt may lead to larger risks, it should be transferred to the risk board. If we have identified an agreed solution to pay down the debt, it should be moved to a ticket in JIRA.

## Infra
- Establish regular check of Trusted Advisor
- Configure correct email address for Trusted Advisor
- Manage service certificate with terraform
- Manage service SES config with terraform
- scheduled scaling for cost saving
- remove dependency on semvertag
- makefile deprecated
- add trufflehog to CI
- allow digideps developers read access to management role

## Application
- Separate config files/entrypoints are inflexible and obfuscating, should use feature flags instead
- YAML files generated by confd reduce image portability
- `behat-debugger.php` requires specific nginx configuration and isn't very useful
- "Route" and "Method" annotations are deprecated in FrameworkExtraBundle, should use Symfony core instead
- `web/assets` being generated in frontend image means it can't be mounted for live-editing

## Design
- Status label texts are variously defined in `common.en.yml`, `ndr-overview.en.yml` and `report-overview.en.yml`
- Many templates are duplicated (e.g. start, yes/no questions, add another)
