# Testing & Debug

This application uses two main testing technologies:

- PHPUnit performs unit tests for individual classes
- Behat performs user tests to ensure whole application journeys work

## How to run the tests

### Unit tests

You can run all tests via the docker container. Note that the first command sets up the database and only needs to be run once.

```sh
docker-compose run --rm api sh scripts/phpunitdb.sh
docker-compose run --rm api sh scripts/apiunittest.sh
docker-compose run --rm frontend bin/phpunit -c tests/phpunit
```

### Integration tests

To run the entire test suite, reset the database and run the `test` image.

```sh
docker-compose run --rm api sh scripts/resetdb.sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run --rm test
```

You can supply additional commands to Behat to run individual suites or tags.

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml run --rm test --suite=admin
```

## PHPUnit

The PHPUnit tests are stored in a directory structure matching `src/AppBundle`. Tests classes should extend `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase` and use methods starting `test` to define actual tests.

We use [Mockery][mockery] to mock classes and entities which are not being tested.

## Behat

Behat tests are run against the environment's client container, meaning test data is stored in the corresponding database. This makes test failures easy to debug, but means that using the application during tests can cause failures.

### Suites

The Behat tests are divided into 6 suites:

- `infra`: A basic set of tests which check the end-to-end application. This allows the tests to fail fast on a critical problems.
- `admin`: Tests for the private administration part of the application.
- `lay`: Tests for lay deputy user functionality. Also tests functionality used by all deputies.
- `ndr`: Tests for the New Deputy Report, filled out by all new new deputies.
- `prof`: Tests for professional deputy user functionality.
- `pa`: Tests for public authority deputy user functionality.

## Emails in non-production environments

Non-production environments don't send emails to avoid data leakage, confusion and embarassment. Instead, email is sent to a mock service which stores it for future reference. You can access the emails stored by the mock service at `/behat/emails` in any non-production environment.

Note that the public-facing frontend and the administration area have separate email stores (both accessible at `/behat/emails` of the relevant service URL).

## Database Sync

The sync process between production and preproduction is handled as part of the pipeline using AWS tasks. To test locally run the sync service with the following commands:

```sh
docker-compose run --rm sync ./backup.sh
docker-compose run --rm sync ./restore.sh
```

## PHPStan

[PHPStan][phpstan] analyses and lints our PHP files to identify common issues which miight otherwise be missed, such as incorrect annotations or using undefined variables. It is run as part of CI against any files which were changed on the branch.

You can also run PHPStan manually. Note that you need to run it against each container separately, and can specify which paths (in this example "src" and "tests" to analyse).

```sh
docker-compose run --rm api bin/phpstan analyse src tests --memory-limit=0 --level=max
docker-compose run --rm frontend bin/phpstan analyse src tests --memory-limit=0 --level=max
```
