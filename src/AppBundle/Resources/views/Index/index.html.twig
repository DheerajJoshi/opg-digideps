        <h2 class="heading-medium">Helpful to know</h2>

        <p>It's OPG's responsibility to look after the client's best interests (the client is the person whose affairs you are looking after). Your deputy reports help us supervise your deputyship.</p>

        <p>You can also use your report to raise concerns and ask for support.</p>

        <p>We first ask you to complete a new deputy report, which records the client's circumstances at the time of your court order.</p>

        <p>You can then use this service to record your deputy decisions as you go along, for a report you send OPG at the end of every year of your deputyship.</p>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">You'll need to provide details of:</h2>

        <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>how the client is cared for</li>
            <li>purchases you've made on the client's behalf</li>
            <li>financial records relating to the client (for example bank statements)</li>
            <li>the client's assets and debts</li>
            <li>any big decisions you have made or are planning to make for the client</li>
            <li>friends, family and professionals you've contacted on behalf of the client</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">Does the client have more than one deputy?</h2>

        <p>You'll only need to submit one deputy report for each reporting period. This applies if you make decisions together (usually called 'jointly') or separately and together (usually called 'jointly and severally').</p>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">What happens after I submit my report?</h2>

        <p>We'll review the report, and may still need to contact you for more information â€“ by phone, email, in writing or by arranging a visit.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Health and welfare deputies </h2>

        <p>We are currently building a digital service for health and welfare deputies. In the meantime, please download and print your annual report form <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/537795/OPG104A-Filling-in-your-deputy-report-form-health-and-welfare-decisions.pdf">here</a>.</p>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">Deputy fees remission or exemption</h2>

        <p>You pay OPG's fees for supervising your deputyship from the client's funds.</p>

        <p>Clients with a lower income may qualify for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deputy-fees-remission-or-exemption" target="_blank">remission or exemption</a>.</p>
