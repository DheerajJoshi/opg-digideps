# Complete the deputy report

This app is the [Complete the deputy report][service] service. It provides an online reporting service used by deputies to submit their reports, and the private area for case managers to review submitted reports.

## Requirements

You must have Docker installed and access to the Ministry of Justice VPN.

##Â Installation

- Add `127.0.0.1 digideps-client.local digideps-admin.local digideps-api.local` to `/etc/hosts`
- Log into the MoJ VPN
- Run `docker login https://registry.service.opg.digital/` with username `opguk-ro` (ask your team for the password)
- Navigate to the root directory of this repository and run `docker-compose up -d`
- Check `https://digideps-client.local/` (Deputy area) and `https://digideps-admin.local/` (Admin area). Your browser will warn you about a self-signed certificate.

### Reset the database

```sh
docker-compose run --rm api sh scripts/resetdb.sh
```

## Terraform installation

To develop with Terraform, you must have the following installed:

- Docker
- Make
- terraform-docs
- jq
- aws-vault for credentials handling (optional)
- direnv (to set shell exports, see .envrc) (optional)

You can then use the make files in `environment` and `shared` to set up the environment.

```bash
# ensure your environment is setup:
export TF_WORKSPACE=myawesomeenvironment
export TF_VAR_OPG_DOCKER_TAG=1.0.myawesometag
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAEXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=cbeamsglittering
cd environment
make

# alternatively, using aws-vault:
export TF_WORKSPACE=myawesomeenvironment
export TF_VAR_OPG_DOCKER_TAG=1.0.myawesometag
cd environment
aws-vault exec identity make
```

## Testing

_See [testing documentation](docs/TESTING.md)_

## Deployment

_See [deployment documentation](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)_

## Built with

- Terraform 0.12
- PHP 7.3
- Symfony 3.4
- Doctrine 2.0
- Twig
- Behat 3
- PHPUnit 4
- [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)

## Xdebug

Xdebug is installed on the container when your local `.env` file in the `opg-digi-deps-docker` repo contains `REQUIRE_XDEBUG_FRONTEND=true`. (See the `opg-digi-deps-docker` README for more information).

Once installed, you can set xdebug config values from `admin.env` and `frontend.env`. For the values to take effect, the env file must contain `OPG_PHP_XDEBUG_ENABLED=true`. The default values currently set are those required to step through the PHPSTORM IDE on a Mac. You will need to configure your IDE, ensuring that the same port is used in the IDE as that set in the `admin.env` and `frontend.env` files.
