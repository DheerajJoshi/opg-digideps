# TODO

## Infra

- Establish regular check of Trusted Advisor
- Configure correct email address for Trusted Advisor
- Manage service certificate with terraform
- Manage service SES config with terraform
- move preproduction to separate account
- scheduled scaling for cost saving
- wkhtmltopdf uses static version
- file-scanner uses static version
- remove dependency on semvertag
- run tests concurrently
- merge this with docs techdebt
- makefile deprecated
- add trufflehog to CI

## Application

- Separate config files/entrypoints are inflexible and obfuscating, should use feature flags instead
- YAML files generated by confd reduce image portability
- `behat-debugger.php` requires specific nginx configuration and isn't very useful
- "Route" and "Method" annotations are deprecated in FrameworkExtraBundle, should use Symfony core instead
- `web/assets` being generated in frontend image means it can't be mounted for live-editing

## Design

- Status label texts are variously defined in `common.en.yml`, `ndr-overview.en.yml` and `report-overview.en.yml`
- Many templates are duplicated (e.g. start, yes/no questions, add another)
- Custom CSS components are baked into application, not properly audited
