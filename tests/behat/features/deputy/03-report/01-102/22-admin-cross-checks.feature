  Scenario: Client search
#    Given I am logged in to admin as "admin@publicguardian.gsi.gov.uk" with password "Abcd1234"
#    And I click on "admin-client-search"
#    Then each text should be present in the corresponding region:
#      | 8 clients | client-search-count |
#    Then each text should be present in the corresponding region:
#      | Cly Hent | client-name-9 |

#    When I fill in the following:
#      | search_clients_q | 104 |
