span.icon {
  /*
  I'm purposefully forcing icons to be used with span tags, some
  implementers like using the i tag, to stand for icon, but we all know
  that really that stands for italic which is semantically incorrect.

  Here's how to use them.

  1. Set the container which holds the icon to have a CSS position, possibly :relative.
  2. Insert the SPAN.icon__??? tag and create a new icon block below.
  3. DO NOT SPECIFY ICON POSITIONS IN THIS FILE, PUT THOSE SPECIFICS
  IN THE  RELEVANT CSS FILE, e.g. An accordion icon can be used in multiple accordion objects
  and the icons location can change so put the positioning CSS in the specific CSS files.
