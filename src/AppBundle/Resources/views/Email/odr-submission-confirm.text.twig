What happens next
-----------------


Now that you’ve completed your new deputy report, you can make use of our annual deputy report service.

Your annual deputy report falls due on the anniversary of your court order – we’ll send you a reminder nearer the time.

However, you can use the service year round to keep track of your deputyship decisions and spending.
