        <p>Dear {{ deputyFirstName }}</p>
        <br/>

        <p>Thank you for submitting your new deputy report.</p>

        <p>We’re in the process of reviewing your report, and will contact you when this has been done.</p>

            <strong>What happens next</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Now that you’ve completed your new deputy report, you can make use of our
            annual deputy report service.</p>

        <p> Your annual deputy report falls due on the anniversary of your
            court order – we’ll send you a reminder nearer the time.</p>

            of your deputyship decisions and spending.</p>
